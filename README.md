# Recruitment_Management-2
To run the project simply create a super-user and then run the manage.py file with code:
1. py manage.py createsuperuser
2. py manage.py runserver
3. log in as superuser when the webserver starts
4. create facilitators ids
5. log out and log in as facilitators
6. create student ids
7. create placement drives
8. log in as student to access and apply to placement drives
Here we need to create a superuser(admin) from which we can create facilitators 
Facilitators will Manage the Students and also the placement related queries
This one contains bootstrap designings
